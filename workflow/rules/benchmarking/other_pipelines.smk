# What to compare when benchmarking UnCoVar to other pipelines?
# -> de novo sequences, consensus sequences, variants calls, lineage (pangolin) calls of uncovar vs other pipeline.
# How to compare de novo / consensus sequences?
# -> Alignments
# --> Edit distances to SARS-CoV-2 reference genome by uncovar vs. other pipeline
# --> Identity to SARS-CoV-2 reference genome by uncovar vs. other pipeline
# --> Share N in de novo / consensus sequence by uncovar vs. other pipeline
# --> Visualise difference in seqs. by uncovar vs. other pipeline (b.c. of masking in uncovar)
# How to compare variant calls?
# -> Number of variants, which are also present in sanger sequencing
# -> Number of total found variants by uncovar vs. other pipeline
# -> Number of variants that were found by both pipelines
# -> Uniquely found variants by uncovar vs. other pipeline
# -> Are there variants that are unique to certain vocs, which are only found by one pipeline?
# -> How to integrate probs/ vafs / depth other VCF metrics?
# -> Precision und Recall auf den von Sanger abgedeckten bereichen berechnen
# How to compare Pangolin Calls
# -> Pangolin call by uncovar vs. other pipeline
# -> How to compare Kallisto?
