Comparison of MEGAHIT, SPAdes, Trinity and Velvet for SARS-CoV-2 assembly. The x-axis shows the median length (N50) from all contigs per sample, the length of the longest contig after assembly (initial) and the length of the sequence after reference guided scaffolding (scaffolded), each in number of base pairs; a) represents patient samples sequenced with shotgun sequencing whereas in b) the samples were sequenced with a multiplex tiling PCR (amplicon) procedure.
