Lineage calls by pangolin on the scaffolded sequences on two batches, each consisting of 500 multi-lineage samples. The horizontal axis bins the proportion of the called lineage contained within the samples, whereas the vertical axis shows the number of samples per bin. If a lineage is called that is contained within the simulated sample (dark blue), then this call appears to be dependent on the lineage proportion within the sample. Furthermore, with an increasing number of lineages per sample, pangolin calls lineages which are not contained in the sample (light blue).
